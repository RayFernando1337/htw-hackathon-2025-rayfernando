Specification: [`phase-2-admin-review-spec.md`](file:///Users/ray/workspace/htw-hackathon-2025-rayfernando/documentation/features/active/phase-2-admin-review-spec.md)

## Overview
Core workflow is implemented end-to-end: review queue, event review with field-level feedback, audit log, notifications on feedback/status changes, and host-side visibility/replies. Remaining work is UI polish and optional notification dropdown.

## Phase Completion Summary
- Phase 2 (Admin Review): ✅ 100% — functional complete; polish pending

## Current Tasks
- [ ] Add notifications dropdown UI for hosts (badge + list) on dashboard header
- [ ] Optional: allow admins to mark feedback threads as resolved from the UI
- [ ] Optional: inline field context preview in Feedback Drawer

## Completed
- [x] Feedback schema (threads, comments, audit) with indexes
- [x] Admin Review Queue (filters, counts)
- [x] Event Review page (grouped fields, drawer)
- [x] Feedback drafts autosave in drawer
- [x] Request Changes + Approve mutations with notifications + audit
- [x] Host-side replies + feedback badges
- [x] Global autosave via `useFormDraft` for forms

## Next Steps
- Implement notification dropdown UI and unread count
- Add "resolve thread" control with status update and audit
- QA across devices; adjust spacing for compact viewports

## Blockers/Issues
- None currently. Performance is within targets; notifications are persisted server-side pending UI surfacing.
