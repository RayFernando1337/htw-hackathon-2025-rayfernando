  - Admin override controls added (status, field edits)

## Completed

- [x] Admin Review Queue (filters, counts)
- [x] Event Review page (grouped fields, drawer)
- [x] Feedback drafts autosave in drawer
- [x] Request Changes + Approve mutations with notifications + audit
- [x] Host-side replies + feedback badges
- [x] Global autosave via `useFormDraft` for forms
- [x] Notifications dropdown UI for hosts with unread count — [`app/dashboard/site-header.tsx`](file:///Users/ray/workspace/htw-hackathon-2025-rayfernando/app/dashboard/site-header.tsx)
- [x] “Fields with issues” + reason on Request Changes; audit + notification enriched — [`convex/events.ts`](file:///Users/ray/workspace/htw-hackathon-2025-rayfernando/convex/events.ts#L489-L499)
- [x] Admin sees latest per-field thread; host reply de-dupe and instant refresh — [`app/dashboard/review/[id]/page.tsx`](file:///Users/ray/workspace/htw-hackathon-2025-rayfernando/app/dashboard/review/%5Bid%5D/page.tsx#L16-L26)
- [x] Stage indicator bar on host/admin pages — [`components/ui/steps.tsx`](file:///Users/ray/workspace/htw-hackathon-2025-rayfernando/components/ui/steps.tsx)

## Next Steps

- Kick off Phase 3 (Publishing) — move optional polish to backlog
- Add "resolve thread" control with status update and audit (optional)
- Inline field context preview in Feedback Drawer (optional)
- “View full thread” modal + anchors (optional)

## Blockers/Issues

- None currently. Performance is within targets; notifications are persisted server-side pending UI surfacing.
