## Implementation Notes

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Simplified Collision Detection**: Focused on venue conflicts rather than audience overlap - much more actionable for admins
2. **Dynamic Checklists**: Automatically generated based on event format (panel, mixer, workshop, general) with due dates
3. **Publishing Flow**: Complete workflow from approval ‚Üí Lu.ma URL ‚Üí publish
4. **Admin UX**: Enhanced review page with venue conflict warnings and status-based actions

### Files Modified:
- `convex/events.ts` - Added Lu.ma URL, checklist, venue conflict, and publishing mutations
- `lib/checklist-templates.ts` - Checklist templates by event type
- `app/dashboard/events/[id]/publish/` - New publishing page and checklist UI
- `components/events/collision-warning.tsx` - Venue conflict detection component
- `app/dashboard/review/[id]/page.tsx` - Enhanced admin review with publishing controls

## Next Steps

1. Implement email notifications for:
   - Event approved (to host)
   - Event published (to host)
   - Admin notifications for venue conflicts
2. Testing and polish
3. Documentation updates

## Blockers/Issues

None currently. All core functionality is working.

## Architecture Notes

- Checklist templates will be configured in `lib/checklist-templates.ts`
- Lu.ma URL validation will be client and server-side
- Collision detection will use time-based queries with audience overlap
- Email notifications will use Convex + Resend component
- Publishing flow will be admin-controlled with final status update
