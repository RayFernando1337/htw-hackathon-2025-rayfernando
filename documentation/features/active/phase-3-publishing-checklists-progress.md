**Last Updated:** 2025-09-16  
**Specification:** [`phase-3-publishing-checklists-spec.md`](file:///Users/ray/workspace/htw-hackathon-2025-rayfernando/documentation/features/active/phase-3-publishing-checklists-spec.md)

## Overview

Phase 3 is ready to begin. Phase 2 is complete with all admin review functionality working. This phase will implement Lu.ma integration, dynamic checklists, and final publishing workflow.

## Phase Completion Summary

| Phase   | Status | Completion | Notes                                     |
| ------- | ------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Phase 3 | ðŸš€     | 75%        | Core flows working; notifications pending |

## Prerequisites Completed âœ…

- [x] Phase 2 admin review workflow complete
- [x] Event approval process working
- [x] Status transitions implemented
- [x] Mobile UX improvements completed
- [x] Navigation fixes applied

## Current Tasks

- [x] Lu.ma URL field for approved events
  - Backend: `convex/events.ts` â†’ `updateLumaUrl`
  - UI: `app/dashboard/events/[id]/page.tsx` and `app/dashboard/review/[id]/page.tsx`
- [x] Dynamic checklist generation based on event type
  - Backend: `convex/events.ts` â†’ `generateChecklistForEvent`
- [x] Checklist task completion tracking
  - Backend: `convex/events.ts` â†’ `toggleChecklistItem`
  - UI: `app/dashboard/events/[id]/page.tsx`
- [ ] Collision detection for overlapping events
  - Implemented basic same-venue same-date detection
    - Backend: `convex/events.ts` â†’ `getVenueConflictsById`
    - UI: conflicts panel in `app/dashboard/events/[id]/page.tsx`
  - Next: add time-window and audience-overlap rules; consider composite index
- [x] Admin "Mark as Published" functionality
  - Backend: `convex/events.ts` â†’ `publish`
  - UI: Publish on `app/dashboard/review/[id]/page.tsx`; plus admin status override on host page
- [ ] Email notifications with Resend integration

## Next Steps

1. Implement email notifications with Resend (approval, publish)
   - Add internal action in `convex/notifications.ts` and schedule from mutations
2. Enhance collision detection
   - Add time-window overlap + audience similarity
   - Schema: consider `events` composite index `by_venue_and_eventDate`
3. Checklist polish
   - Auto-generate on approval; expand templates beyond `general`
4. Admin UX polish
   - Add explicit Publish/Unpublish on host detail page admin card; onCalendar toggle

## Blockers/Issues

None currently. All Phase 2 dependencies are resolved. Performance remains within targets.

## Recent Completions

- Admin controls
  - Forced status changes: `convex/events.ts` â†’ `adminSetStatus`; UI in `review/[id]` and `events/[id]`
  - Admin field editing at any step: `convex/events.ts` â†’ `adminUpdateFields`; UI uses admin edit mode on host page
- Admin visibility
  - Admin can view any event detail: `getEventById` ownership gate relaxed for admins
  - Admin dashboard lists all events; stats aggregate all: `getMyEvents`, `getEventStats`

## Architecture Notes

- Checklist templates will be configured in `lib/checklist-templates.ts`
- Lu.ma URL validation will be client and server-side
- Collision detection will use time-based queries with audience overlap
- Email notifications will use Convex + Resend component
- Publishing flow will be admin-controlled with final status update
