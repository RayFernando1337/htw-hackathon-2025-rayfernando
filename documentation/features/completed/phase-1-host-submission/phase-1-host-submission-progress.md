# Phase 1: Host Event Submission - Progress

Status: Completed | Date: 2025-09-14

## Highlights

- Draft-friendly validation on client; strict validation at submit
- Global toasts added; clear submit-time error surfacing and step focusing
- Save handler aligned with Convex (`agreementAcceptedAt` mapping)

## What Shipped

- Create, update, submit, delete mutations with ownership checks
- Event detail page with edit toggling and submit guard
- New event wizard with auto-save and progress indicators

## Known Follow-ups (Phase 2 Prep)

- Admin review flows: `requestChanges`, `approve`, audit trail surfaces
- Checklist UX after approval; publish integration (Luma URL validation)
- Role-based access for admins to view all events

## Verification Checklist

- Create draft → fields persist via auto-save
- Submit with missing fields → inline errors + toast + focus first invalid
- Submit with complete fields → status transitions to submitted/resubmitted
- My Events dashboard displays updated counts and statuses

## Artifacts

- Convex: `convex/events.ts`
- Schemas: `convex/schema.ts`, `lib/validations/event.ts`
- UI: `components/event-form/*`, `app/dashboard/events/*`
