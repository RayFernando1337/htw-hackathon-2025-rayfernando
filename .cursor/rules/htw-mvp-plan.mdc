# HTW Event Platform MVP

- The single source of truth is `documentation/features/planned/htw-event-platform-mvp-plan.md`.
- Implement phases in order (0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4). Do not start later phases early.
- Match field names exactly to the plan's Fillout mapping.
- Enforce server-side state machine transitions and permissions.
- Use Convex subscriptions for realtime updates.

Docs lifecycle (see AGENTS):

- Planning spec lives under `documentation/features/planned/`.
- When active, move spec to `documentation/features/active/` and add `-progress.md`.
- When complete, move both to `documentation/features/completed/[feature-name]/`.
