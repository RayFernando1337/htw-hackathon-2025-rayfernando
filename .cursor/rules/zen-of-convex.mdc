# Zen of Convex highlights

- **Use queries for reads**; let the sync engine manage cache/consistency.
- **Keep sync functions fast** (<100ms, few hundred records max).
- **Use actions sparingly** for external integrations and background work.
- **Donâ€™t overdo client state**; bind components to queries.
- **Record progress** incrementally when actions orchestrate workflows.
