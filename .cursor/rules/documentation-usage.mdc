description: How to use the /documentation workspace, feature lifecycle, and file conventions

# Documentation workspace usage

- **Start here**: Read [documentation/README.md](mdc:documentation/README.md) for structure and standards.
- **Lifecycle authority**: Follow [documentation/AGENTS.md](mdc:documentation/AGENTS.md) for feature lifecycle moves.

## Feature lifecycle

1. Planning → `/documentation/features/planned/[feature-name]-spec.md`
2. Active → move spec to `/documentation/features/active/` and add `[feature-name]-progress.md`
3. Completed → create `/documentation/features/completed/[feature-name]/` and move both files there

## Naming conventions

- Kebab-case file names
- Specs end with `-spec.md`
- Progress trackers end with `-progress.md`

## Agent checklist when moving features

- Create completed folder: `/documentation/features/completed/[feature-name]/`
- Move spec and progress files from `active/` into the folder
- Update relative links between spec/progress if needed
- Search repo for references to old active path and update

## Where to look

- Current work: `/documentation/features/active/`
- Completed patterns: `/documentation/features/completed/`
- Future work: `/documentation/features/planned/`
