description: Use Bun and Bunx for package management and scripts in this repo
---

# Bun usage guidelines

This project uses Bun. Prefer Bun over npm/yarn/pnpm for all package and script operations.

- **Run scripts**
  - `bun run dev` → Next dev
  - `bun run build` → Next build
  - `bun run start` → Next start
  - `bun run lint` → Lint

- **Add deps**
  - `bun add <pkg>`
  - `bun add -d <pkg>` for devDeps

- **Ad-hoc CLIs**
  - Use `bunx` for generators and one-off CLIs
  - Example (shadcn): `bunx --yes shadcn@latest add button`

- **Non-interactive**
  - Default to non-interactive flags in CI/agents (e.g., `--yes` when supported)

- **Lockfile**
  - `bun.lock` is the source of truth; do not introduce other lockfiles

- **Environment**
  - Ensure Bun is installed locally/CI. Node scripts should be Bun-compatible.
